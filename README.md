##  End-to-End Automation Testing with Pytest & Selenium

Multi-browser framework for End-to-End Automation Testing with PyTest-Selenium and Page Object Model.

The automation task can be completed with the URLs that are provided. Once one test run is completed, another URL must be used in order to run the test again. (Since we split and pay custom amount, we are going to need to either edit the split or pay the rest if we want to use the same URL.)

URL can be changed in settings.py file


To run the test go to the test_qlub_automation_task.py page and click on Run button.

Methods and locators are stored in qlub_automation_task.py page

##  Running the project:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies from requirements file.
3. CD into the `PYTEST-AUTOMATION-FRAMEWORK` folder
 

The browser by default is chrome, this can be changed in the settings.py file
